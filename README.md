# CLI Tool for automatically creating PR with description based on commits

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to create a new pull request (PR) on GitHub with a description generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The tool is written in JavaScript and requires no dependencies.

## Usage

To use this tool, simply call `create-pr` with no other arguments. This will create a new PR on GitHub with the target branch set to the one specified in the environment variable `CREATE_PR_TARGET` and the source branch set to the current working branch.

The tool will automatically generate a description for your PR based on the commit messages in your branch. The description text will be generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT, which uses machine learning to generate natural language text.

If you would like to customize the description text, you can do so by adding a `.pr-description` file to your branch. The contents of this file will be used as the description for your PR.

## Installation

To install this tool, simply run:

```sh
npm install -g create-pr-cli
Copy
